Overview

This project uses Facebook Graph API and Love Calculator API to help user find their “right” person on Facebook. It requires users to log in with Facebook on the home page.  

After the user clicks on the “log in” button, the log in page will pop out. Users need to input their Facebook account and password to log in. 

After the user successfully logged in, the main application page will be shown. The left hand side shows the user’s profile picture and name, and on the right hand side, there is an input area for user to enter a name for calculating whether they are a good match. 

There are some example outputs after the user clicked “calculate” button.The result will first show the percentage. Higher percentage means the user and the person with the name being entered are a better match. There will be a description of the calculation result below the percentage. If the percentage is greater than 40%, the application will show the user some suggested Facebook users who own that name. The user can then click on the profile pictures or the names of the suggested lovers to see their Facebook home page. 




Limitations

First, since Facebook does not allow developers to publish their applications without submitting them for approval, only the administrators, developers and test users can log in and use this application. That means, if you want to test the application, you need to contact Selena(Yiyun Xu) and give me your Facebook username. Then, I can add you to the developers or the test users. After you accept my request to be the developers or test users, you can log in and use the application. 

Second, after the user log in Facebook, the user needs to refresh the page to update the log in status. We are not sure why this happens and how to handle the problem.

Finally, we changed a little bit from our original proposal. Since Facebook no longer allows developers to retrieve any user’s full friend list, we are not able to get the names of the users’ friends. So, instead, we let the users to input a name themselves, and do the calculation. The suggested lovers are in the range of all Facebook users, not only the users’ friends any more.
